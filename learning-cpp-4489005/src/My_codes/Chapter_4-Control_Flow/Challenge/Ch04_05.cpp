// Calculate a GPA, by Eduardo Corpe√±o 

// Your task is to calculate the grade point average, or GPA, for a student. You'll retrieve the data from a vector of grades, and you'll print the GPA on the screen.
//  As a part of calculating the points, we'll use this table to convert letter grades to points.
// A is worth four points, B, three points, C, two points, D, one point, and zero points for an F.
// notice that line 31 (student_str = students[0].get_name();) is just a placeholder that gets the name of the first student in the student's vector.
// So please replace that line with the correct code to get the name of the selected student into the student SDR string.
