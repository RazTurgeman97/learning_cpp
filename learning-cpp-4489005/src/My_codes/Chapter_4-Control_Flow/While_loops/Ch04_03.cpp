    // initizalizing it with "numbers.begin()" makes it an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector.
    // instead of using a type name as complicated as "srd::vector<int>::iterator", we used auto instead.

        ptr = next(ptr, 1); // move the iterator forward by one position by using the function "next".
